Version 1.10 of my Super Meat Boy "Control Center"

I will be actively working on this in order to make it perfect. 



**Important**

I have gone ahead and fixed the need to change your DVD drive letter. At this point, as long as your
Steam folder is located within the A, C, D, E, or F drive, this program will work. If, for some reason,
your steam folder is located within another drive letter, please feel free to send me a message at the 
email below, and I will go ahead and re-build a program and add your drive letter.


If you find any bugs, or something not working, please feel free to email me at:

mdiggss@gmail.com

Please make the subject line Super Meat Boy so I can sort through my messages with ease.

Enjoy

P.S. Before anyone asks, No, I will NOT be charging for this program, or any of the future updates. If you want to support me, please spread
the word about this program and share it with the Super Meat Boy community. And sure, checkout my stream (http://www.twitch.tv/diglio/new)
