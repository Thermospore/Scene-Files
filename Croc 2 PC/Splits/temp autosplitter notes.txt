Masher WW re-entry cancel doesn't work
	maybe make LastWad more specific?
		would proably have to rename it & separate it from CurTribe in debug output

get rid of individual options for debug output?
	or maybe have the individ ones enabled by default

livesplit might be grabbing map values while they are in the middle of being updated sometimes?
	So far I've only noticed it when changing to and from GOA map
	this might be the source of those double split bugs elsewhere
		because it makes it look like there were two map changes in a row
	potential work around:
		turn up script refresh rate,
		find a val that lets you know if update is in progress,
		if so, don't let livesplit update the CurWad value until the next cycle
			(so, write the old.CurWad values back into current.CurWad)
	HOWEVER now I'm not so sure
		I tried cranking up the refresh rate to 1999hz (max) and grinding hub GOAs
		didn't catch the middle of a map change a single time...
		removed refresh rate def (to set it to default) and quickly got it twice in a row lol
		maybe it's because 1999 doesn't evenly fit in to 30, so makes it less likely to overlap? no clue
		Yea, I got it quickly at 90hz, 120hz, 150hz but never got it at 121hz
		just got it at 151hz after maybe 10 tries tho...
		oh wow I just got twice at 1999hz in the first 10 tries wtf haha
		gonna have to ask hdc0 about this one lol
		might be able to detect it by looking at mainstate/ingamestate/isloaded values
			I think hdc0 has explanations for each of those values on his github
		
refresh rate
	maybe turn up refresh rate to 120hz, so you have accuracy through the hundreths place
	how much strain does cranking the refresh rate up to max cause?

count secret gems and or eggs as progress? what are they internally?

does 100% cutscene stuff work alright? is that inca spawn valid OTS start?

RequireUnusedBossWarps
	add explanitory text?
	move further down in the settings list?
	add popup window (req'd by chef). see smb splitter
		You have used a boss warp! To allow timer start, please either restart your game or disable this safety in the autosplitter options.
		
"This now works even when exiting via GOA!
	honestly should probs just get rid of this; there are a bunch of other updates I'm not adding tooltips for

IW end
	wait... don't you need to enter shop in sailor 100%, for example? or did we change rules for that??

invert OTS SMP option?

when you die in hub it doesn't change your spawn point. you just go to the current one.
	double check
	update in options text
	info spreadsheet
	
need a secret hub map detection function too?
	
does // Cancel if old progress list is not available have to be up there?
	could combine the splintered IL/OTS end sections if not
	check the commit where that was added

simplify hub goa detection to get rid of the latter 3 PrevWav values
	have a bool in update set true if goa was in hub (probably need to init to 0 somewhere)?
	using the map values is not 100% consistent; reverting to using PrevWad
		I think livesplit catches the game while it's in the middle of updating map values sometimes...
		Think it happens so quickly the autosplitter refresh doesn't usually catch it?
		Seems tribe is updated last
		I'm hoping this issue is specific to GOA... the autosplitter relies heavily on map changes being accurate
	simply detect the invalid hub spawn directly?
		would be useful for WW detection too
		
move ww detection fn to a bool in update?

bad hub spawn blocks
	make it so OTSstart don't start with
		gobbo hub
			(doesn't start on level entry for ww)
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after GOA in gobbo hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't start)
		secret hub
			(secret hub is disabled)
	
	make it so IL/OTS end doesn't split for	
		gobbo hub
			[COMPLETE] entering level to do a ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after GOA in gobbo hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't split)
		secret hub
			(no WW in secret hub)
			(again, no WW in secret hub)
			[COMPLETE] spawn in secret hub after GOA in secret hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't split)
			
	ideas for (wait maybe make these functions too? can you call functions in functions??)
		detect entry for ww
			can check if reentering a non-hub level you already completed (RTH flag?)
		detecting ww
			HOLUP I bet you can get logic to work on mapchange
				old.AllowReturnToHub == 1
				non hub level -> hub level (use that function)
				old.PrevTribeSS0 is already 0
				
			ugh I hate setting flags for later
			make this check and store for later (maybe in `update`?)
				AllowReturnToHub == 1
				not in hub (use that function)
				InGameState == 7
				PrevTribe went to 0
				rest of PrevWad equal to current map
			once at map change
				drop split if ww
				set flag to 0 at some point
					maybe in update?
					be careful tho, sometimes map change and 7->0 happen on same loop
		detect GOA in hub
			just make sure the save slot PrevWad isn't hub map!
			maybe can do if old map goa, current map is hub, and prevwad == map
			
	hub ids
		gobbo 	secret
		1234	555
		1111	234
		1111	111
		0000	000
	
	update so any saveslot can be used
		can you just use the idx thing like a pointer index or whatever?
		can use RequireUnusedBossWarps as an example?

ww detection is a function but in hub goa is written out twice...?
	might have to un-functionify ww detection to access all saveslots anyway
	so... wait and see
	could have a bool in update act like a function?

Is insta warp shop same map as normal shop?
	not that you would often start an IW this way, but it should at least work

update OTS to reflect
	options changes
	no multiple ww splits now, see how that efefaarffects things
	some people might be using the old splitter which splits on starting cutscene
	sweep for any other changes
	name change
	
hardcore IL stuff
	split on each door transition
	split on each lap
	split on each crystal
	maybe put babies subsplits under there too

0. format
	-[a/A] change needed/completed in Autosplitter
	-[b/B] change needed/completed in leaderBoard rules
	-[N] No action
	-[?] Under investigation
	
1. [ab] change IW start to be just like IL start (when the map ID changes to the hub)?
    -could get to the start through the cheat menu or through manually exiting smp
    -would accommodate IWs taken from fullgame runs
    -very minor effect to existing IW runs
    
2. [b] allow IWs from fullgame, not just sailor?
    -Sailor only is just a holdover from c2gbc at this point, I think, especially if we start from map change

3. [b] Change IW rules to be more like the way ILs are?
    -no longer intended to be set up as if it's a segment from a fullgame run
    -explicitly allow whatever items and hearts you want
		-[?] *including golden gobbos?*
    -explicitly require 100% or max% requirements for each level

4. [N] how should sailor be handled?
    -start at exit from SMP like all the other IWs and allow whatever lives and items?
    -or keep it as is (start at newgame)?
	
5. [?] how to handle puzzles-dante entry for ILs?
	-spawn conditions for GOA vs menu vs normal entry for plane onwards?
	-do autosplitter start & split work the same starting one of those levels from
		-GOA?
		-level select menu?
