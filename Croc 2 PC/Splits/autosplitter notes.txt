check 100% post dante crystal
	dante crystal		YES (traditional ending point)
	dante->cutscene		?
	cutscene->credits	?
	credits->inca		?
	inca->SMP			?
	SMP->secret			YES (start of OTS seg)
	
prog split loop simplification
	move 100% end egg split outside of the loop, by dante crystal split
	gate the entire loop behind the prog split option, since why else would you need to use it now

ideas from MoonBunnie on asl discord https://discord.com/channels/144133978759233536/144134231201808385/880666397842235473
	That is a very detailed break-down, thank you! I don't know the game, but my ideas of things to explore would be as follows:
	I'd first try changing the conditions for what counts as a map change. Since we can't reliably assume all 4 change at the same time, you could limit when the check happens by using another variable. As an example, if the InGameState changes to 7 always immediately after a map change, you could perform the map check only when that happens. You would need to track the old values yourself though, and only update them during that check (in case InGameState can change to 7 without map changing). 
	Alternatively, if you only need to detect the change cleanly and don't care about the actual map values, then you could fix double splitting by adding a minimum "cooldown" to your splitting function to prevent it from splitting twice in rapid succession.
	And going off 2838's idea of lowering refresh rate of livesplit, if the actual ids do matter, you could start a cycle count/timer when any of the ids change, but not actually perform any functions pertaining to map changing until the timer has expired or reached a minimum. This would cause all your map changing logic to be always be delayed, but it would hopefully always correctly catch the late updates.

I think race condition applies to all map changes, it's just that most map changes only differ by one of the ints...
	Complete solutions
		If it was simply a matter of avoiding double splits, a cooldown could be added
			but a lot of logic relies on looking for specific map changes or patterns of map changes
		Could find a val that lets you know if curWad update is in progress,
			if so, don't let livesplit update the CurWad value until the next cycle
			(so, write the old.CurWad values back into current.CurWad)
		Can the garbage map value ever equal a real map?
			if not, you can just filter it out
			what order are the ids updated in? this will help eliminate possibilities
				if curLevel updates first then from larry->hub the garbo id would equal flavio...
			I'd rather not do this
				it would be better to just have a blanket solution
				than to have to try and define what is a real map id vs a garbage map id
		Could delay current/old by one cycle to effectively "see into the future"
		Could do some spooky code injection! :):):):):):)
	Partial solutions
		Could compare with the curWad in your saveslot, but that would only work for some cases
		Could use PrevWadSS for some stuff probably
		Could add a cooldown to prevent double splits

Why does timer sometimes move a little bit after load at the very end of keith IL? 

Oh god what to do about how you spawn at WW spawn when you GOA or return to hub out of boss room
	maybe add this to the bad hub spawn info down below

refresh rate
	maybe turn up refresh rate to 120hz, so you have accuracy through the hundreths place (?)
	how much strain does cranking the refresh rate up to max cause?
		basically none, looking at task manager..?

RequireUnusedBossWarps
	add explanitory text?
	move further down in the settings list?
	add popup window (req'd by chef). see smb splitter
		You have used a boss warp! To allow timer start, please either restart your game or disable this safety in the autosplitter options.
		
IW end
	wait... don't you need to enter shop in sailor 100%, for example? or did we change rules for that??

when you die in hub it doesn't change your spawn point. you just go to the current one.
	double check
	update in options text
	info spreadsheet
		also put RTH in boss levels into the table
	
need a secret hub map detection function too?
	
does // Cancel if old progress list is not available have to be up there?
	could combine the splintered IL/OTS end sections if not
	check the commit where that was added

hub goa detection
	simplify to a function or a bool in update?
	revert to PrevWadSS0, if CurWad race condition is a problem?
	simply detect the invalid hub spawn directly?
		would be useful for WW detection too

move ww detection fn to a bool in update?
	might have to un-functionify ww detection to access all saveslots
	could use functions inside of the function too :)
	
make it so any saveslot can be used
	can you just use the idx thing like a pointer index or whatever?
	can use RequireUnusedBossWarps as an example?

bad hub spawn blocks
	make it so OTSstart don't start with
		gobbo hub
			(doesn't start on level entry for ww)
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after GOA in gobbo hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't start)
		secret hub
			(secret hub is disabled)
	
	make it so IL/OTS end doesn't split for	
		gobbo hub
			[COMPLETE] entering level to do a ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after GOA in gobbo hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't split)
		secret hub
			(no WW in secret hub)
			(again, no WW in secret hub)
			[COMPLETE] spawn in secret hub after GOA in secret hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't split)
			
hub ids
	gobbo 	secret
	1234	555
	1111	234
	1111	111
	0000	000

update OTS to reflect
	options changes
	no multiple ww splits now, see how that efefaarffects things
	some people might be using the old splitter which splits on starting cutscene
	sweep for any other changes
	name change
	
hardcore IL stuff
	split on each door transition
	split on each lap
	split on each crystal
	maybe put babies subsplits under there too

0. format
	-[a/A] change needed/completed in Autosplitter
	-[b/B] change needed/completed in leaderBoard rules
	-[N] No action
	-[?] Under investigation
	
1. [ab] change IW start to be just like IL start (when the map ID changes to the hub)?
    -could get to the start through the cheat menu or through manually exiting smp
    -would accommodate IWs taken from fullgame runs
    -very minor effect to existing IW runs
    
2. [b] allow IWs from fullgame, not just sailor?
    -Sailor only is just a holdover from c2gbc at this point, I think, especially if we start from map change

3. [b] Change IW rules to be more like the way ILs are?
    -no longer intended to be set up as if it's a segment from a fullgame run
    -explicitly allow whatever items and hearts you want
		-[?] *including golden gobbos?*
    -explicitly require 100% or max% requirements for each level

4. [N] how should sailor be handled?
    -start at exit from SMP like all the other IWs and allow whatever lives and items?
    -or keep it as is (start at newgame)?
	
5. [?] how to handle puzzles-dante entry for ILs?
	-spawn conditions for GOA vs menu vs normal entry for plane onwards?
	-do autosplitter start & split work the same starting one of those levels from
		-GOA?
		-level select menu?
