in the debug text for wad/map IDs:
	add a line that tells you the level name for that map ID!
	or if it's an invalid/unknown ID!

max% feature to help with forgetting crystals?
- don't split when exiting without 100 crystals?
- ping / alert when exiting without 100 crystals?

RequireUnusedBossWarps
	add explanitory text?
	move further down in the settings list?
	add popup window (req'd by chef). see smb splitter
		You have used a boss warp! To allow timer start, please either restart your game or disable this safety in the autosplitter options.
		cheatengine address: 622D50

IW end
	wait... don't you need to enter shop in sailor 100%, for example? or did we change rules for that??
		oh I think hdc0 used to have code here that checked your save file for completion lol...
		can probably just re-add that
	also see skedpal:
		"Wait... should Max/100% Inca IWs end on dante yellow crystal or on entering SMP? cos you can do Jigsaw after dante"

Why does timer sometimes move a little bit after load at the very end of keith IL?
	well... I guess it must be because the load ends a split second before map change? could be a race condition thing...
	yuuuuup pretty sure it's a race condition between the map ID and InGameState + IsMapLoaded
	ACTUALLY... I thought that HAD to be it, BUT
		I grinded entering / exiting a level (roger) until I got it,
		and the autosplitter debug output is identical and doesn't show a race condition..?
		might be an issue on liveplit's end?

refresh rate
	maybe turn up refresh rate to 120hz, so you have accuracy through the hundreths place (?)
	how much strain does cranking the refresh rate up to max cause?
		basically none, looking at task manager..?
		see if the game appears more laggy in dxwnd
	actually shoot, would this cause the race condition to happen more frequently?
		actually I fixed the race condition so non-issue B)
	whelp, I tried adding a timer to measure the cycle time, then tried different refreshRate values:
		I could get the refresh rate to lower, but I couldn't get it to go faster than the default refresh rate...
		no matter how much I cranked up the refresh rate, I couldn't get it to go higher lol
	if we want something faster / more accurate, I think we would just have to go the DLL route

need a secret hub map detection function too?
	actually, can just make the normal hub map detection function work in secret too?
	then we can pair with a curtribe == 5 or a curtribe != 5 alongside, as needed
	
does // Cancel if old progress list is not available have to be up there?
	could combine the splintered IL/OTS end sections if not
	check the commit where that was added
	add some debug output to see where this is actually having an effect

I'd have to think about this, but maybe instead of painstakingly individually detecting every situation with a valid / invalid hub spawn (ie WW, SQ, GOA in hub, etcetc) I can just directly detect which spawn is being used (the SMP exit one or the general hub one)..?

Oh god what to do about how you spawn at WW spawn when you GOA or return to hub out of boss room
	maybe add this to the bad hub spawn info down below

when you die in hub it doesn't change your spawn point. you just go to the current one.
	double check
	update in options text
	info spreadsheet
		also put RTH in boss levels into the table

hub goa detection
	simplify to a function or a bool in update?
	simply detect the invalid hub spawn directly?
		would be useful for WW detection too
	
bad hub spawn blocks
	make it so OTSstart don't start with
		gobbo hub
			(doesn't start on level entry for ww)
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after GOA in gobbo hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't start)
		secret hub
			(secret hub is disabled)
	
	make it so IL/OTS end doesn't split for	
		gobbo hub
			[COMPLETE] entering level to do a ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after ww
			[COMPLETE] spawn in gobbo hub after GOA in gobbo hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't split)
		secret hub
			(no WW in secret hub)
			(again, no WW in secret hub)
			[COMPLETE] spawn in secret hub after GOA in secret hub
			(from load is already disabled)
			(from death simply doesn't split)
			
hub ids
	gobbo 	secret
	1234	555
	1111	234
	1111	111
	0000	000

update OTS to reflect
	options changes
	no multiple ww splits now, see how that efefaarffects things
	some people might be using the old splitter which splits on starting cutscene
	sweep for any other changes
	name change
	
hardcore IL stuff
	split on each door transition
	split on each lap
	split on each crystal
	maybe put babies subsplits under there too

0. format
	-[a/A] change needed/completed in Autosplitter
	-[b/B] change needed/completed in leaderBoard rules
	-[N] No action
	-[?] Under investigation
	
1. [ab] change IW start to be just like IL start (when the map ID changes to the hub)?
    -could get to the start through the cheat menu or through manually exiting smp
    -would accommodate IWs taken from fullgame runs
    -very minor effect to existing IW runs
    
2. [b] allow IWs from fullgame, not just sailor?
    -Sailor only is just a holdover from c2gbc at this point, I think, especially if we start from map change

3. [b] Change IW rules to be more like the way ILs are?
    -no longer intended to be set up as if it's a segment from a fullgame run
    -explicitly allow whatever items and hearts you want
		-[?] *including golden gobbos?*
    -explicitly require 100% or max% requirements for each level

4. [N] how should sailor be handled?
    -start at exit from SMP like all the other IWs and allow whatever lives and items?
    -or keep it as is (start at newgame)?
	
5. [?] how to handle puzzles-dante entry for ILs?
	-spawn conditions for GOA vs menu vs normal entry for plane onwards?
	-do autosplitter start & split work the same starting one of those levels from
		-GOA?
		-level select menu?
