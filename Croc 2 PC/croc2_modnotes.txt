				-btw, there is also a cheat for infinite lives. You can even enable it when you're currently in a level by modifying the int32 at 0x4B7964. I always set this value to -1 (= all bits set) to enable all cheats including cheat menu when testing things
				
				-Citing an old Discord post: >the int32 variable at 0x622c44 (US) specifies how you can move. It's 0 when you can move freely, 0x1000 when talking with a Gobbo, 0x2000 while a cutscene is running, 0x6000 while riding a mine cart. You might use "Find out what writes to this address" in Cheat Engine to find out when the value is changed.
