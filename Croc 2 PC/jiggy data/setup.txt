movement type 2 (camera independent movement and much increased consistency)

hang on the ledge where we jump from (snaps angle to cardinal direction!)

run against/past stonehenge rock and get shoved to the left (should end up in front / a tad to the right of the fire). This seems to be the most inconsistent part of the setup

do the 180 flip (same button as camera snap on type 1)

right step 1x (should be at about X = 79950)

run forward to a specific part of the texture (doesn't need to be very precise!)

don't move backwards on the ground, because that changes croc's angle! you can move backwards in the air if you need to though. your angle should still be exactly 0 at this point.

tap right a certain number of times on kb (very brief taps. your angle changes by a consistent amount each tap!)

once you are sure you are inside, switch back to type 1 before proceeding to shove into the corner like normal. type 2 doesn't seem to shove him into the corner the same way

NOTE: tapping forward on the kb always steps you forward by the same amount as well. maybe this could be useful.
