no opening cutscene split
no ww splits
now smp splits

Look in splits file:
	What info does a split contain?
		at what point in your pb (or wr△) that split was completed
		for each run, the amount of time you took for that segment
		your gold
		
	What info should it contain after you have edited the splits?
		no opening cutscene split / no ww splits (joining multiple segments together)
			at what point in your pb (or wr△) that split was completed
				keep the time of the last split
			for each run, the amount of time you took for that segment
				sum the times together
				if there was a reset before the last split, don't record any time for that run
			your gold
				options:
					A. sum golds (not as realistic SoB, but acceptable and probably simpler)
					B. actually parse through and find the fastest you did that stretch of splits (more realistic SoB, but not as simple)
		
		now smp splits (break up a segment)
			at what point in your pb (or wr△) that split was completed
				initial splits
					blank??
				final split
					time of original split
			for each run, the amount of time you took for that segment
				blank for all segments??
			your gold
				blank for all segments??
				
		(will probably have to shuffle segments or replace segments at some point)
				
	In what manner do you need to edit the splits to achieve that state?
		no opening cutscene split / no ww splits (joining multiple segments together)
			simply deleting all but the final split gives expected result, with gold option A.
