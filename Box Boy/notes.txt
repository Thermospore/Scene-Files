boxboy notes

-can move into tighter vertical gaps when falling by waiting to move until you are past the upper wall

-for 22-6 you can make the block extend before and after the star gate so it breaks intentionally

 12                     32
-Q3 throws further than Q1

14 frames	0.233 sec	time to walk 1 block	
10 frames	0.166 sec	time to generate 1 more block
06 frames	0.100 sec	time to get pulled 1 block at hook speed

-if you have to generate blocks while running, stop at a spot that snaps you forward

-always jump the gap with as little blocks as possible
	-unless it's a 3 block gap, then walk with 2
		-(it is just as fast to jump with 1, but that is harder)
